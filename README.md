##  Given Directions
* Consumes a MySQL slow query log - a sample log has been attached.  Assume the DB schema only has one table named `posts`.
* Display aggregated summary statistics for all SELECT, DELETE, INSERT and UPDATE queries.
* Provide some assurance your code operates as expected.
* BONUS: Update the script to take an argument to aggregate based upon an arbitrary time window.
